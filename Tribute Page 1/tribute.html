        <h2>About the legend</h2>
        <p class="about-content">Tim Berners-Lee is an English computer scientist who is credited with inventing the
            World Wide Web. He wrote the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990, and the first web server in 1991.</p>
        <p class="about-content">Berners-Lee was born in London, England, on June 8, 1955. He studied physics at the
            University of Oxford, and then worked as a software engineer at CERN. <br> In 1989, he proposed the idea of
            the World Wide Web as a way to share information between scientists. He developed the basic technologies of
            the Web, including HTML, HTTP, and URIs.</p>
        <p class="about-content">The World Wide Web quickly became a global phenomenon, and Berners-Lee is widely
            credited with its invention. <br> He has received numerous awards for his work, including the Millennium
            Technology Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research, and the ACM Grace
            Hopper Award. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">Berners-Lee is a visionary leader who has had a profound impact on the world. He is the
            father of the World Wide Web, and his work has changed the way we live, work, and communicate. He is a
            tireless advocate for the open and democratic nature of the Web, and he is committed to using the Web to
            improve the lives of people around the world.
